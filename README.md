# Openface-Real-Time-Face-Recognition
Free and open source face recognition with deep neural networks.

OpenFace is a Python and Torch implementation of face recognition with deep neural networks and is based on
the CVPR 2015 paper FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering by Florian Schroff, 
Dmitry Kalenichenko, and James Philbin at Google.

Normaly Harcascade is used by most of the devlopers for the face detection purpose but instead of that here I used DNN
for face detection which is way more accurate way of detecting faces than Haar Cascade.
